# Pong-Snake-Game
Multi menu application with pong and snake games.

## Description
The problem that is going to be faced is an arcade-like game with Pong and Snake. This program will be layered with a menu that leads the user to two difficulty levels of snake, the instruction manual, and pong. Snake is a single-player strategy game that requires the user to maneuver their snake to collect all the apples without touching the walls or hitting themselves. Pong is a player versus player game in which players try to score a ball into the enemyâ€™s net.
